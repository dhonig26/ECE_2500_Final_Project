Ever wonder what the color code of the resisotor you are looking for is? Well, this project allows the user to enter in a resistor value and it will output the color band for you to look for.

For the final project I plan to create a program that will calculate the resistor color code based on a value passed in as an argument. I plan to create error checking to make sure the user is entering a valid number. This program will embody the unix philosophy because it will be simple and allow for expansion upon it due to its simple nature.
