Ever wonder what the color code of the resisotor you are looking for is? Well, this project allows the user to enter in a resistor value and it will output the color band for you to look for.

<!-- more -->

To make run 'clang -o main main.c'
Then run './main <insert resistance value here>'

For the final project I am creating a program that will calculate the resistor color code based on a value passed in as an argument. I plan to create error checking to make sure the user is entering a valid number. This program will be simple and allow for expansion upon it.
